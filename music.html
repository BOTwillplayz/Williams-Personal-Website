   <h1> ARCANE: </h1>
<h2>Arcane League of Legends (Soundtrack from the
Animated Series):</h2>
<h2>Playground (Bea Miller) <audio controls src="music/Bea Miller Playground Arcane League of Legends.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	Very strong start to this album and the show arcane in general, I like the dark tone 		of the song and (I think) it is percussion instruments that really make this song 			stand out to me, it is an amazing song truly leaving little to be desired, although that 		doesn’t mean to me it is a great song, although it has its merits I would hardly say it 		is repayable or amazing song writing, but the vocal performance Miller gives is 			commendable, leading to award it 67/100. <br>
<h2>Our Love (Curtis Harding & Jazmine Sullivan) <audio controls src="/music/Our Love Arcane League of Legends.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	Woah, what a song, one if the most underrated songs on the album with its 				throwback style and flipping incredible vocal performances, the chill vibe and aura 		of the song both make me feel like I am happy on a rainy day and crying at my 			grandma’s house at once. The replayability on this track is VERY sadly lacking 			leaving it with an amazing 79/100 (I tip my hat to Harding and Sullivan, their 			performance was *chefs kiss*<br>
<h2>Goodbye (Ramsey)<audio controls src="music/Goodbye Arcane League of Legends Music.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	This song unfortunately falls flat in terms of its predicable sound and nature leading 		it to be one of the more forgettable songs of the album with it being rather dull and 		uninspired, although there is a silver lining and that is Ramsey’s excellent vocal 			performance, all in all I gave this song a deserving 51/100 <br>
<h2>Dirty Little Animals (BONES UK)<audio controls src="/music/Dirty Little Animals - Bones UK.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	What a vibe of a song, really really awesome. Thats about it lads 73/100 (if you are 		wondering about the very high score it comes from the replay value in addition to 			the originality, something I think especially arcane artists forget, which is why it is 		the true make or break of your score and where Ramsey and Bea Miller missed out) <br>
<h2>Enemy (Imagine Dragons)<audio controls src="music/Enemy - Imagine Dragons & JID from Arcane.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	(Preface: Although I am the Number 1 Imagine Dragons Hater I tried not to let this 		bias get in my way) NONONONONO I HATE IMAGINE DRAGONS *dying*. Ok but 			credit where credit is due, I don’t hate this song with it being an absolute ear worm 		and having good production and vocal qualities, butttt with that being said that does 		not excuse that song of being my number 1 sin, coworker music, it’s the anthem of 		people who pretend they’re fighting anime battles, but those battles are mostly 			passive-aggressive Teams messages. In conclusion it is a 54/100 (by what grace of 		god is this higher than Goodbye by Ramsey I feel bad for my generation) <br>
<h2>Guns for hire (Woodkid)<audio controls src="music/Guns for Hire - Woodkid.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	This is by far my favorite track on the album with next to no flaws, (and an awesome 		scene in arcane but that is irrelevant), the replayability and emotional connection 		on this song are incredible leading me to award it a prestigious award as the first 			song on my 85/100+ playlist getting an astonishing 86/100 <br>
<h2>Misfit Toys (Pusha T)<audio controls src="music/Misfit Toys - Pusha T & Mako.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	Oh this track just reeks of arcane and I live for it, it is definitely on of the best songs 		off of this album with Pusha T giving a good performance but the biggest credit going 	to Sebastien Najand and Alex Seaver, who are the composers, lyricists and 				producers who did the heavy lifting on this song. 68/100 <br>
<h2>Dynasties and Dystopia (Denzel Curry, Gizzle & Bren Joy)<audio controls src="music/Dynasties & Dystopia - Denzel Curry, Gizzle, Bren Joy.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	What an awesome song, the only issue is I liked more before the singing started, 			which is not something you want, although this song has really good replay value. At 	the 1:02 mark is my favorite part of the song with the awesome beat and best vocals 		coming to fruition. 65/100 <br>
<h2>Snakes (PVRIS, MIYAVI)<audio controls src="music/Miyavi PVRIS Snakes League of Legends.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>With the opening sounding vaguely like a song from wreck it ralph as opposed to 			arcane this song simply falls to the despair pit that is forgettability, on another 			sound track it may of stood out but on this soundtrack it falls so flat, now that 			doesn’t mean that this song doesn’t have its moments, I just that this song is 			unbelievably MID. 50/100 <br>
<h2>When Everything Went Wrong (Fantastic Negrito)<audio controls src="music/Fantastic Negrito - When Everything Went Wrong.mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>THIS! THIS is how you do country music, awesome, flipping amazing it has this                   	perfect chaotic energy and perfect vocals, it is so Elvis coated and I love it. 71/100 <br>
<h2>What Could Have Been (Sting & Ray Chen)<audio controls src="music/What Could Have Been - Arcane (1).mp3"></audio><br></h2>
<p>	Woah this song is by Sting!? My parents love that dude, this song must be amazing, 		*puts in headphones* Wow who could have guessed! It is mid as hell and sounds just 	like every other song on the arcane soundtrack, its only redeeming characteristic is 		the fact that the violin in this track is just to incredible. 9 year old William would 			have liked it alot more: 55/100<br>
